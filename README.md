# Analyze_NYSE_Data
A Udacity (Masterschool) project

## Kaggle's New York Stock Exchange S&P 500 dataset

### Introduction
In this project, I was able to analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. A subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies was drawn. A smaller subset of the data I used for the project was provided by Udacity.

### Tools
I used Google Sheets to perform my analysis, the link to my google sheet can be found in the reference section of my ppt.

### Purpose of Project
In this project, I went through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing any inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics, and using models to forecast fututre growth prospects for the companies. The goal was to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.

### Skills I used:
The main goal of this project was for me to demonstrate my ability to:

-interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range).

-use a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX, and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, dropdowns, data validation, VLOOKUP).

-analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Excel or Google Sheets.

-create visualizations of a business metric and use Excel or Google Sheets to create a financial forecast model.
